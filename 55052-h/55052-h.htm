<span class="i0">Save where the new wheat lifts itself to the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And huddles in rows, like wrinkles in some old gown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the lane the quail are running in fright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At sound of guns on the upland&mdash;the cautious dogs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are coursing over the fields, and keen-eyed men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watch for the whir of wings; the hickory logs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are falling down in the clearing, while in their pen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The big swine gloat on the heaped-up trough;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In woods the dead leaves rustle, and red squirrels cough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chatter and screech&mdash;chasing each other from limb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To limb, and gather their stores at the roots of trees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And part of it all is a boy, and the heart of him<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Down in the valley the ancient village rests,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drowsing along the curbs of its quaint old street;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High and peaked are the roofs, and antique crests<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are carved on the gables. Fair maids, discreet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sit on the porches and talk with the passing youth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Love goes by, sometimes in homespun clad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sometimes rich in the wealth of truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That speaks in the heart and the eyes of the lad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For none that pass are the eyes of the bonny girl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except for him; she sits and waits by a climbing vine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reading the verses of some old bard; the pearl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She seeks is love, and only love is the wine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That colors her cheeks and snaps in her sparkling eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the lad is shy, and dreams the livelong day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That love and his lady are proof against all surprise&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Slender saplings have sprung to giant trees;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gray is his head and furrowed his brow with care&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heart of the man cries out to the Autumn breeze.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dusk in the valley, and cold light on the hill&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brown is the sumach, the glory of youth has fled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drowsing cattle shiver, the night is chill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Memory lives, but all of his hopes are dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Years has he wandered over the land and sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Friends he has cherished and lost, and women loved;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Always that vision haunted his fancy free&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dreamer worshipped, but never the vision proved.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down in the valley the ancient houses sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dotted with lights that break through the evening gloom;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dreams that stirred the face of the waters deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cover their eyes and flee to a welcoming tomb.<br /></span>

the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
